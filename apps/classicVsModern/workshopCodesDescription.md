### **_Classic vs Modern Heroes_**

Have you ever thought how the game would look like, if you could put classic Overwatch 1 heroes against modern Overwatch 2 ones, or even if you could mix them all together?
Well now you can, with configurable Self Healing and Tank Bonus Health passives!

**==NOTE:==** This mode doesn't recreate nor it magically brings back the "old" heroes. Instead, it relies on Blizzard reintroducing the classic heroes in their time-limited events. Once the time-limited event is gone, this mode **will no longer function**, until the next Classic event is introduced.
