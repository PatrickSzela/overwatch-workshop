### Who doesn't love some chaos?

Charge the global meter by dealing damage, healing and using ultimate.
Once the meter is fully charged, the same randomly selected modifier will be applied to each player.

**New:** Now also with Twitch integration! Instead of charging the meter, let your chat vote on the next modifier - [external application](https://github.com/PatrickSzela/overwatch-workshop-integrations) required
